Time to quit stocks? All in ETF,"Been investing in stocks for the last 13 years. I recently calculated my returns and my CAGR is approximately 20% over 12 years. The S&P500 was 12% during the same period. 

I hit on some big winners like AAPL, CMG and NET. I held a very concentrated portfolio. Early on I was 70% AAPL. Then I diversified into more companies to lower risk. 

I’m thinking of quitting stocks and just going all in ETF. It takes a considerable amount of time to research and keep up with a dozen or so companies. And something is telling me I got damn lucky. 

If I continue to strongly out perform the market the next 5-10 years it could make a big difference. But I could also get crushed for having a highly concentrated portfolio. I don’t like to hold more than 20 or so companies. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and just cashed in your chips and went 100% etf? 

At this point I don’t really enjoy the grind of investing in individual stocks. It is purely for profit. 

Did think about going mostly etf and some stocks. But won’t make much sense since it will take just as much time to do research on a smaller stock portfolio ",162,0.13363809523809525,2025-07-09 18:42:44,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lvwoal/time_to_quit_stocks_all_in_etf/,investing,positive
"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures fall as Trump targets August 1 for country-by-country tariffs","US stock futures fell Sunday as President Trump and top administration officials suggested country-specific tariffs would take effect on Aug. 1, offering more potential confusion to trading partners but also potential breathing room for negotiations.

Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) all dropped around 0.3%.

Trump had targeted July 9 as a self-imposed deadline, when his ""pause"" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China.

But on Sunday, both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump suggested that while Trump could send out letters this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1.

""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on Aug. 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent told CNN's ""State of Union.""

AAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names.

Bessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation. Wall Street is waiting to see how trade talks between the European Union and Canada go, in addition to other key partners.",133,0.060879629629629624,2025-07-06 22:03:33,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lticg3/stock_market_today_dow_sp_500_nasdaq_futures_fall/,stocks,positive
"Apple is resilient, but stock buybacks are diverting capital from its moat","As a longtime Apple customer, I deeply understand its value proposition. However, management is facing a declining moat from the disruptive growth of artificial intelligence in the hardware space, which poses a price-return risk. Management would be wise at this point to focus less on stock buybacks and more on effectively investing cash flow into more aggressive M&A and better R&D talent. I predict Apple stock will return 10% annually over the next 12 months. I also predict Apple will return 10% annually over the next 10 years as well.

AAPL has been relatively weak so far in 2025. As of June 17, shares were trading at $195.64, down $2.83 intraday (-1.43%) Cumulatively, the year-to-date decline is about 20%, making it one of the worst-performing tech giants in MAG7

In the last month, the stock price has oscillated between $196 and $202 since the end of May, and is still below the key 50-day SMA of $205.69 and the 200-day SMA of $225.74, indicating that medium- to long-term downward pressure still exists.From a fundamental standpoint, Apple achieved revenue of $95.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 5% year-over-year Diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, both of which exceeded Wall Street's expectations

The stock price is currently in the vicinity of 193 U.S. dollars has important support, if broken may further test the 180 U.S. dollars line, and above the key resistance in the 214-216 U.S. dollars range, once recovered will be expected to regain the momentum of the rebound if the AAPL fell to 193-190 U.S. dollars range,

can be considered to take a small position in the low batch of buying, using the average support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If AAPL falls to $193-190, you can consider taking small positions to buy in low batches and take advantage of the SMA support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If the price can recover $205-206 and stabilize above it, it can open up space for a larger rally.",72,0.027508960573476706,2025-06-17 19:46:26,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1le2m3m/apple_is_resilient_but_stock_buybacks_are/,stocks,positive
EU issues tough warning of countermeasures if US-EU trade talks break down - will markets falter?,"Background Sorting: 

Trade tensions between the US and Europe have heated up again over the past two weeks. Despite the departure of the Biden administration, Trump reinstated some of the tariffs on Europe prior to his campaign, particularly related to automobiles, precision manufacturing equipment and green energy products.

Today, EU Vice-President Sefcovic made it clear that if negotiations fail, the EU will not hesitate to take reciprocal countermeasures, including imposing tariffs or limits on U.S. high-tech products, cloud services and chip equipment.

Short-term market judgment: 

If the US-EU talks continue to stall, it will weigh on large-cap tech stocks in the short- to medium-term, especially for companies with high international revenue share (e.g., NVDA, AAPL, AMD).

However, if positive signals of progress in negotiations can be released later this week, the market will repair quickly.

The current rise in volatility expectations for August in the options market suggests that institutions are already hedging their bets against conflicting risks.

My strategy (not a recommendation): 

Lightly hold tech ETFs (e.g. QQQ) and closely monitor the EU response meeting on 7/16 

If conflict escalates, plan to buy short-term defensive ETFs (e.g. XLU / SH) if the VIX breaks 15+ 

Watch for shifts in international stances during the Biden and Trump campaigns, as the policy set-ups will influence the direction of capital allocation in Sept.

Will Trump's tariff delay spark a short-term stock market rally?,"Trump to delay tariff deadline, sends trade letter to 12 countries. This may sound like run-of-the-mill political news, but given the current macro backdrop, there may be more to this than meets the eye.

The Trump administration's new round of tariffs, which were set to begin this month, have now been postponed.

Letters have reportedly been sent to 12 countries that could involve renegotiating or easing trade restrictions.

The timing is very sensitive - CPI is due out soon (July 10th) and markets are now betting on a Fed rate cut in September.

What I think the impact will be: 

Easing Trade Tensions = Risk Appetite Rebound 

Historically, whenever there is an easing of trade protectionism, market risk appetite improves, particularly favoring the following sectors: tech hardware (e.g., chips, Apple supply chain) export-oriented industrials (e.g., Caterpillar, Boeing) retailers with large exposure to the global market (e.g., Nike, Costco) The SPX Index, affected by the news Futures were up +0.6% in pre-market, but it's hard to say if that will last.

 Possible Dollar Weakness?

If the market interprets this tariff delay as Trump “softening his stance” for the election, then the dollar could pull back. This is usually good for: commodities, emerging markets, large multinational exporters.

My view: 

I think this news is a positive sign for the markets, especially as it adds fuel to the already bearish sentiment. Currently, the market also has the following: Q2 earnings season is about to kick off (with low benchmark expectations favoring “over-expectations”), the Fed has been dovish in recent statements, global manufacturing data is stabilizing, and the Fed will continue to be a major player in the global economy.

If the CPI data on July 10th is modest and trade news becomes clearer, we could see a positive market, but there are some potential risks: if the news is just “political posturing” without any real progress, the market could quickly overreact and retrace its gains.

What I'm watching: 

NVDA / AVGO - High beta tech stocks benefiting from global demand for semiconductors and rebound in market sentiment 

 XLI - Industrial sector ETF with Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), 3M and other components sensitive to global trade and exports 

 AAPL / AMZN - Globalized, tariff-sensitive giants where policy direction has a significant impact on valuation 

Welcome to the discussion: 

Do you think this tariff delay is a material positive? Or is it political maneuvering before the election?

 Is it a “bull trap” waiting for everyone to get cut during earnings season?",38,0.10540899023457165,2025-07-07 14:16:28,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lu1mcq/will_trumps_tariff_delay_spark_a_shortterm_stock/,stocks,positive
